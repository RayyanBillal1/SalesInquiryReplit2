all data stored and managed in a database. Currently, the system has critical errors—pages, buttons, and core features are broken. Fix the following issues and ensure seamless functionality:
1. Database Integration
All data (contacts, tasks, deals, messages, settings) must be stored, updated, and retrieved from a centralized database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Firebase, or MongoDB).
Ensure real-time sync—any changes (add/edit/delete) reflect immediately across the app.
2. Fix Broken Pages (404 Errors)
Tasks Page:
Fix loading issues; users must view, add, edit, and delete tasks.
Ensure due dates, priorities, and assignees work.
Messages Page:
Restore messaging functionality (internal chat or email integration).
Analytics Page:
Fix dashboard errors; display real-time stats (deals won, tasks completed).
Settings Page:
Allow profile updates, role permissions, and system configurations.
3. Fix Non-Working Buttons & Features
Contacts Page:
'Add Contact' button: Fix form submission (name, email, company) and save to DB.
Search function: Enable filtering by name, email, or tags.
Pipeline Page:
'New Deal' button: Must create and save deals to the database.
Drag-and-drop functionality: Allow moving contacts/deals between stages (Lead → Qualified → Proposal).
Custom Pipeline Flow: Add a button to reorder stages (e.g., swap 'Qualified' and 'Lead').
Notifications:
Alerts for new messages, task deadlines, or deal updates.
4. Task Management Fixes
Users cannot add tasks → Fix form submission and DB integration.
Task view page (404) → Rebuild with details like status, assignee, and comments.
5. Technical Implementation
Backend: Node.js (Express) or Python (Django) with RESTful API.
Database: PostgreSQL (for relational data) or Firebase (for real-time updates).
Frontend: React.js/Vue.js for dynamic UI (drag-and-drop pipelines).
APIs:
Use Google/OAuth2 for email sync if needed.
WebSockets for live notifications.
6. Expected Deliverables
A fully functional prototype with zero 404 errors.
All buttons, forms, and drag-and-drop features working.
Database proof (e.g., sample data entries for contacts/tasks).
Documentation explaining fixes and how to extend features.
