You are helping build a web application in Replit that integrates with a user's Gmail, Google Calendar, and Contacts. The app should allow the user to:

1. Log in with Google and get their Gmail profile info.
2. Load Gmail messages and allow replying to emails.
3. Read and update the user’s Google Calendar (view events, add appointments).
4. Load and sync Gmail Contacts (view and add).
5. All changes (replies, added contacts, events) should reflect back into the user's actual Gmail/Calendar/Contacts (sync is two-way).

Fix any issues related to OAuth or redirect URL failures.

Make sure:
- Proper Google OAuth 2.0 scopes are used.
- Gmail API, Calendar API, and People API are enabled.
- Discovery Docs are used for all 3 APIs.
- The app is deployed on Replit (e.g., https://<project-name>.<user>.repl.co or Janeway custom domain).
- Authorized JavaScript origins and redirect URIs are correctly set to match the Replit deployment URL.

Write a full HTML + JavaScript (Vanilla JS) code snippet that:
✅ Initializes Google API client  
✅ Performs login  
✅ Displays Gmail profile info  
✅ Loads Gmail inbox (subject + sender)  
✅ Replies to an email  
✅ Loads Google Calendar events and adds an appointment  
✅ Lists existing Gmail contacts and adds a new one  

Use the following scopes:

const SCOPES = [ 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts' ].join(' ');

And add scopes which should be there according to our application.

Assume I’ve already created a Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID and added the Replit URL to Authorized JavaScript Origins and Redirect URIs.

The code should:
- Use gapi.client.init() with correct discoveryDocs for Gmail, Calendar, and People API
- Use `gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance().signIn()` for login
- Include working buttons: Login, Load Profile, Load Gmail, Reply Email, Load Calendar, Add Event, Load Contacts, Add Contact
- Show the results in simple HTML

At the end, include instructions to:
- Enable Gmail API, People API, and Calendar API in Google Cloud Console.
- Where to paste the OAuth Client ID and API key in the code.
